## Nations Trust Bank: Buy the dip @ 127

I closed my previous position at 135.75, using Fibonacci retracement to identify my exit point, coinciding with the all-time high (ATH) at that time.

Now, I'm eyeing an entry point around ~127. The chart shows two circled doji candles, signaling a potential reversal. Additionally, the notable decrease in volume supports a likely pullback.
